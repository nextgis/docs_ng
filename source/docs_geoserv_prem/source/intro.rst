Introduction
========

**NextGIS GeoServices on-premise** is a specialized web application deployed on the company's server. It gives users access to various highly loaded tile services. 

It allows to create and manage basemaps using data from OpenStreetmap and NextGIS Web in raster or vector formats.

The application has its own system for managing, authorization and logging.

Menu on left has three main blocks:

* Overview
* Services
* Settings

In `Services <https://docs.nextgis.com/docs_geoserv_prem/source/services.html>`_ you can find all services added to the app (basemaps etc) and add new ones. Services can be divided into groups (managed by the Administrator in Settings -> Service groups).

`Settings <https://docs.nextgis.ru/docs_geoserv_prem/source/settings.html>`_ - here users manage their profile, other users, user groups, map settings and logs.

**Overview** has general information about the services that are used. This block is in development.
